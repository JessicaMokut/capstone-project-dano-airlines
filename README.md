DANO AIRLINES PASSENGER SATISFACTION ANALYSIS - DOCUMENTATION

Project Overview

This project analyses airline passenger satisfaction data from over 120,000 passengers to uncover key factors influencing both positive and negative travel experiences.
The goal was to:

•	Identify trends across customer types, travel classes, and service touchpoints

•	Understand how these factors impact passenger satisfaction

•	Provide data-driven recommendations to improve overall customer experience

Key Dataset Columns

•	Satisfaction – Passenger satisfaction level (Satisfied / Dissatisfied)

•	Customer Type – First-time or Returning passengers

•	Type of Travel – Business or Personal travel

•	Class – Travel class (Economy, Economy Plus, Business)

•	Age – Passenger age

•	Service Ratings 0–5 – (Inflight Service, Seat Comfort, Online Boarding, etc.)

•	Arrival Delay and Departure Delay

Process & Approach

1. Data Preparation
   
•	Imported dataset into Power BI

•	Cleaned data:

o	Removed missing values and irrelevant columns

o	Created Age Group column using ranges: <25, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55+

o	Verified and corrected data types

3. Transformations & Measures
   
Created DAX measures for:

•	Total Passengers

•	Total Female & Male Passengers

•	Overall Satisfaction Rate

•	Average Service Ratings (across multiple service factors)

4. Dashboard Design

Built two interactive dashboards:

•	Overall Satisfaction Overview:

o	KPIs (Total Passengers, Gender Breakdown, Satisfaction Rate)

o	Satisfaction by Type of Travel, Customer Type, Class, Gender, and Age Group

•	Pain Point Analysis:

o	Top 10 Pain Points for Dissatisfied Passengers

o	Comparison with Satisfied Passengers (Side-by-Side View)

Used a clean, business-friendly layout with slicers for filtering.
